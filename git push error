Reason: Because the default starting branch of git has been changed from master to main, that's why your git command is not recognizing the master branch and giving you a "ref" error.
I had the same problem.

The solution was, in my branch, called "testBranchSuper", I used

#git checkout -b main
and then I used

#git push heroku main
